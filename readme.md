# Lumen and Vue

This project is to be used for consuming an JSON API produced by Lumen Endpoints, by a VueJS application.

For easier prototyping, the single HTML web page that boots the Vue application is also served by the Lumen framework, but this can be easily moved to an independent project.

## Features out of the box:

 - Authentication
 - Cors
 - JSON Error handler

## Lumen (API Backend)
Laravel Lumen is a stunningly fast PHP micro-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Lumen attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as routing, database abstraction, queueing, and caching.

#### Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Lumen website](http://lumen.laravel.com/docs).

#### Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within Lumen, please send an e-mail to Taylor Otwell at taylor@laravel.com. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

#### License

The Lumen framework is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Vue (Front-End)

Vue (pronounced `/vjuÀê/`, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, and can easily scale between a library and a framework depending on different use cases. It consists of an approachable core library that focuses on the view layer only, and an ecosystem of supporting libraries that helps you tackle complexity in large Single-Page Applications.

#### Browser Compatibility

Vue.js supports all browsers that are ES5-compliant (IE8 and below are not supported).

#### Documentation

The official documentation is at [vuejs.org](https://vuejs.org/)
